Nightmare items no longer drain Sanity with time, just when used.

No longer lose sanity for having these equipped.

Dark Sword - Takes one Sanity for each Use.
Night Armour - 10% of damage taken is subtracted from Sanity. (unmodified)
Night Light - Does not drain sanity. A nightmare fuel provides a day of light. Can be given three fuel for three days of light! Great for ruins and caves.
