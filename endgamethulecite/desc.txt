A Thulecite Club is only 150 uses, and a Dark Sword is easier to obtain and deals more damage! Sad the the Thulecite items aren't even that good compared to how much work it is to get all that Thulecite and all those Gems? Want to use all that nightmare fuel you have accumulated? This mod is for you!

It dramatically improves the efficiency of all the Thulecite Items, they are about 2-4 times as good for a 25% increase in cost.

The Green Amulet has been repurposed as a super anti-starvation item, making you able to last 30 days without food.
