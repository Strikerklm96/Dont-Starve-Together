A Thulecite Club is only 200 uses, and a Dark Sword is easier to obtain and deals more damage! Sad the the Thulecite items aren't even that good compared to how much work it is to get all that Thulecite and all those Gems? Want to use all that nightmare fuel you have accumulated? This mod is for you! 

The Thulecite items now last a lot longer, are better, and would likely require multiple Worlds to get all of them. Are you up for the challenge? Some items have been modified to be less boring, and provide something not provided by vanilla items. The Thulecite Crown for instance is quite a bit different. The Construction Amulet and Deconstruction Staff were changed, otherwise they could be used for insane amounts of Thulecite.

Metrics and Strategy: 
The average item is about 5 times better per cost than it used to be. 

The Energy Amulet saves Wilson about 2800 hunger (20 meaty stews), and the convenience of not carrying around food. It is also really effective for Wolfgang to easily hold 290 + hunger and get his speed and damage buff. With the Thulecite Club and max food, he would deal 170 damage per hit, killing Deerclops in 12 hits, and 16 hits with the Dark Sword. Combine this with the Anti-Energy Staff, and bosses are easily dispatched. 

The Thulecite Crown can be used to kill hordes of spiders and other creatures, since you are invincible and immune to Stun Lock. Just be sure to get to safety for when the Shield disapears. 

Use the Magiluminescence to explore caves. It provides a huge sanity buff, and provides light. 

The Pick/Axe plus Lazy Forager make tree and boulder farming insanely fast. 

Lazy Explorer is an improved walking cane with teleporting abilities. Obvious implications. 

Anti-Energy Staff lets you catch birds really easily. Just put them to sleep when they land. 

Obviously if you have any of this stuff in your game currently, it will be at its old durability.
