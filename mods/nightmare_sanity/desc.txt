Also has a Don't Starve version, ROG Compatible!

Nightmare items no longer drain Sanity with time, just when used.

Dark Sword - Takes one Sanity for each Use.
Night Armour - 10% of damage taken is subtracted from Sanity. (unmodified)
Night Light - Does not drain sanity. A nightmare fuel provides 15 days of light. Can be given 4 fuel for 60 days of light! Super efficient, but more expensive now.
