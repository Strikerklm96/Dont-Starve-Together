The items bosses make have been improved dramatically.

Insulated Pack - Can now prevent frozen items (ice,icecream, etc.) from spoiling. Piggyback size.

Luxury Fan - 25 uses instead of 15. Cools more. Larger cooling radius.

Weather Pain - 25 uses instead of 15.

Hibearnation Vest - Twice the insulation factor (now 480), equivalent to wearing a Beefalo Hat and Puffy Vest.

Scailmail - 50% more durable. Absorbs 99% of damage instead of 70%

Scaled Chest - I haven't figured out how to improve this yet. (working on it)

Scaled Flooring - Double movement speed. Trippled heat resistance for structures or objects on it.

Scaled Furnace - This is already good.

Eyebrella - Lasts 15 days instead of 9. Can still be repaired.
