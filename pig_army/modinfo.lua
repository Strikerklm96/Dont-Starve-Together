description = "Create an army of Pigmen! Feed a Pigman two Meaty Stews or an equivalent hunger value of meat and he will become loyal permanently. Make him stop following temporarily by trying to give him a twig. He will also say how much health he has. Feeding meat will heal him. Make him follow again by giving him a vegetable. Pigs and Werepigs are much stronger in combat now too. After reloading the game, pigs stay loyal, but stop following, so just give him a vegetable."
